<h2>Common Usage Scenarios</h2>
<p>This section describes few common usage scenarios for ParrotSMTP in conjunction with Burn After Reading (BAR) client.</p>
<h3>Scenario A: Anonymous Web Registration</h3>
<p><b>Problem:</b> You want to register a temporary account on some web-site, but it requires you to enter a <b>valid</b> email address which will be used to send a verification code back to you to ensure that the email address you've provided is valid.<br/>
	<span style="font-size: small;">For some reason you don't want to use your email address (perhaps, because you're afraid of spam) and you are too lazy to create a new one in gmail.com. You also <b>don't care</b> much about your <b>privacy</b> (if someone steals this account from you).</span></p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> You submit a registration form using an arbitrary email, the only requirement is that it must have <b>${parrotsmtp-domain}</b> as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Domain_part">domain part</a>, for example you may use something like <i>abrakadabra@${parrotsmtp-domain}</i>. Then you obtain your email using the <label for="recipient" style="font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer;">form</label> on the top of the page. Your email will be deleted from the server immediately after you get it.</p>
<h3>Scenario B: Underground Mailbox</h3>
<p><b>Problem:</b> You need to leave a message to your friend. You don't trust anyone.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> You connect to <b>${parrotsmtp-domain}</b> on port <b>25</b> and leave a message. You communicate using SMTP. Your friend reads a message using BAR client. Here is an example of leaving a message using telnet (John leaves a message for Carol):</p>
<pre class="console">
C:\>telnet ${parrotsmtp-domain} 25
Connecting To ${parrotsmtp-domain}...


220 ParrotSMTP at your service
HELO John
250 OK
MAIL From John

Oh my God, Carol, they found me. I don't know how, but they found me!
They're breathing down my neck.
Contact me asap!

John

250 OK
QUIT
221 Service closing transmission channel

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<b>Q:</b> Is it secure?<br/>
<b>A:</b> No, <b>it is not</b>:
<ol>
	<li>No SSL support yet.</li>
	<li>
		ParrotSMTP in conjunction with BAR client has a very <i>specific</i> security. An attacker can access a recipient's message if and only if he <b>knows</b> the recipient's name and until the message <b>exists</b> in the system.<br/>
		<span style="font-size: small;">That is, if you are using a &quot;hard-to-predict&quot; recipient's name (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local_part">local part</a> of the email address) then it is unlikely that an attacker can guess it and obtain your message; if you've already obtained it through the BAR client then this message no longer exists in the system and an attacker can't get it even if he knows recipient's name.</span>
